RNO-G Control Microcontroller Firmware 

Cosmin Deaconu <cozzyd@kicp.uchicago.edu> 

Firmware for the controller board for RNO-G. This runs on a SAMD21J18A microcontroller. Obviously you'll need the arm cross-compiler installed. 

This project is based on atmel START (ASF4) but without the normal file structure :) 

Directory structure: 

  application/ most of the application code
  asf4/  autogenerated ASF4 files (other than main.c of course) 
  bootloader/ bootloader
  build/ (generated by Makefile) build happens in this directory
  config/  header files configuring the build 
  docs/ Documentation 
  lorawan/  the LoraMac endpoint reference implementation, ported to this microcontroller. 
  linker/  linker scripts 
  shared/  code shared between application and bootloader  (outside of asf4 and config) 
  client/ userspace loading programs for loading a program to the bootloader via usb or uart. These are built separately.
