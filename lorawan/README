mac/ and radio/ are straight from the reference implementation. 

system/ contains headers used only by mac/radio, most of which are wrappers. This is a bit of a waste of code size but it beats trying to edit the implementation. 


All of the code that's customized for our integration is under the board directory, but much of it is taken from the SAML21 implementation of the same. 

Note that the initialization of the board is handled elsewhere so there are a lot of empty things here! 

import.sh can be used to copy over new files from LoRaMac-node
