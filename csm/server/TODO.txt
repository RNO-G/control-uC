TODO: Bug-test this

TODO: periodic thread
---------------------

For periodic commands like LTE-ON and LORAWAN pings, have the server create a thread dedicated to periodic command pings

This thread can send these pings based on a condition, timer, etc.

TODO: logging
-------------

If this is made into a systemd unit, have the server print out to stdout so that systemd can log the server

Furthermore, have the server and client data structures consider SIGTERM, since systemd uses that to shutdown units
